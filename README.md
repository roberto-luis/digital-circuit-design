# digital-circuit-design
A collection of lab reports displaying the design and simulation of logic gate designs in Cadence. Gate implementation as well as silicon implementation used.

Lab1:
  Create a full adder, 4-bit adder, 4-bit register, 8-bit adder with logic gates and test files with SPECTRE

Lab2:
  Design inverter, NAND gate, and XOR gate using npn and pnp transistors. Also create layout designs for each.

Lab3:
  Test delay of inverter, NAND, and XOR using spice. Find sink capacitance for each design.

Lab4:
    Design schematic and layout for 1-bit adder. Test delay using waveforms and find power consumption of inverter, NAND, XOR, and 1-bit adder.

Lab5:
  Design schematic and layout for 4-bit adder. Test delay and power consumption of each case.

Lab6:
  Design schematic and layout for D flip-flop. Use waveform to test delay of rising edge and falling edge cases. Find setup delay where largest value of rising and falling delay still has the correct output.

Lab7:
  Design layout for cruise control module with specific area constraints.

Lab9:
  Find the maximum path and optimize design to reduce delay.
